OpenBRAS is an open-source program made by Branimir Rajtar (branimir.rajtar@gmail.com).

It's purpose is to give an open-source implementation of a Broadband Residential Access Server to the community. Currently, it's acting as a regular PPPoE server and it will be enhanced in the future, by adding support for new functionalities, as listed below.

Usage:
- connect customers on one Ethernet interface and a link to the Internet on the other interface
- change parameters in openbras.conf accordingly
- run "make" in Linux command prompt
- run "sudo ./openbras [CONFIGURATION FILE]" and enter sudo password

Future work, by priority:
1. Create subscriber database in MySQL; it will also enable
	user authentication (currently, no authentication is implemented)
	CHAP (currently, only PAP is allowed)
	user accounting
	redundancy upon program restart
2. Program optimizations
	enable running as a service
	fix memory leaks
	implement LCP Protocol-Reject
	add additional IPCP options (currently, only IP address and Primary DNS are implemented)
3. RADIUS authentication and accounting
4. Multiple subscriber- and Internet-facing interface (currently, only one for Internet and one for subscribers are enabled)
5. VLAN tagging
6. Performance optimization
	kernel module
	separate threads for packet processing
7. IPv6
8. ACLs, rate limiting, NAT, L2TP, RPF check, etc.
